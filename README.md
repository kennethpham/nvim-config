# My Neovim Config

- Uses [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as its plugin manager
- Uses [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) to handle any language servers
- Any plugins configurations are done in the `lua/packer/configs` directory
- Other neovim settings are done in `lua/settings.vim`
